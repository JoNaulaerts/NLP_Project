# NLP_Project: Personal Learning Assistant

## Project assignment
### Platform
- Use CrewAI, LangGraph, … to build a multi-agent personal learning assistant

### Goal (MVP)
- The assistant responds to user questions through a chat interface
- Demonstrate multi-agent collaboration (at least two interacting agents)
- Integrate at least one MCP tool (e.g., RAG search, web API, or document retriever)
- Maintain short-term context continuity within a conversation
- Produce useful educational outputs (e.g., summaries, explanations, or quizzes)

### Possible Extra’s / Extensions / Extra credit
- Experiment with additional tools or agent roles for richer collaboration
- Add long-term memory using a vector database for persistent recall
- Implement adaptive behavior where agents reflect and improve over time
